# SFRC-data

This dataset was generated by FEM and used for TGML (Theory-guided Machine Learning) and TPML (Two-Phase Machine Learning) to predict stress-strain curves of short fiber-reinforced composites.

## Data Description

This dataset has 814 SFRC data with their material properties and stress values at 101 evenly distributed strain points.

Models with names start with A are the data with aspect ratio = 1. (Total: 214)

Models with names start with B are the data with aspect ratio = 4. (Total: 200)

Models with names start with C are the data with aspect ratio = 7. (Total: 200)

Models with names start with D are the data with aspect ratio = 10. (Total: 200)

## ML Code Sample

This sample demonstrates our TGML's process for task B. The Young's moduli of the composites are predicted by Halpin-Tsai model and then taken as one of the input parameters for ML training.
